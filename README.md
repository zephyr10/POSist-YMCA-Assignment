Here we are given user data in the form of node. each data node contains owner name , address, mobile,phone in encrypted format. We have some variables like NodeNumber , Child NodeId etc which are given primitive data types. Also , there are some pointers to variables like ReferenceNodeId and ReferenceChildNodeId .With each rcord is associated a timestamp variable of type daytime.
Here we are given various functionalities which are needed to be implemented using any technology.

In this Assignment, I have only done the front end part as proper IDE's aren't available on the systems for smooth running and debugging purpose.

For this assignment, the wireframe structure in my mind was a login or signup option on a nav bar on top, which can take user credentials and verfy them. After that user is presented with another pop up window which sends an encrypted code on user's specified account.when user clicks on that encrypted link sent to him let through gmail, another window gets open where user is logged in now. After that a side menu appears which provide user with various options. User can select any and then log out after work is done.

Due to time constraints , I am able to make only front End templates.
